numpy==2.0.2
opencv-python-headless==4.10.0.84   # OpenCV without GUI, safe for Railway
ffmpeg-python==0.2.0                # Re-encode processed video so browsers can play

# --- OPTIONAL: YOLOv8 (heavy: pulls PyTorch CPU, may exceed Railway free tier) ---
# Uncomment below if you want YOLOv8 tracking/overlay
# ultralytics==8.2.103
# torch==2.3.1+cpu
# torchvision==0.18.1+cpu

# Notes:
# - Keep YOLO commented if you only need OpenCV overlays (lighter, deploys faster).
# - Railway free tier may not have enough memory for torch + ultralytics.
# - For YOLO in production, consider GPU-enabled VM or async worker.
